##### Sed Basics

- `sed` can delete lines, substitute text, append text, or extract text from text files.
- By default, `sed` prints the entire file as a stream, but you can modify this behavior using switches.
- Use `-n` to suppress automatic printing of the entire file and selectively print lines.
- Use `sed '1d' filename` to delete the first line in a file.
- With `-i`, you can edit the file directly instead of just printing output.
- To substitute text globally, add `g` at the end of the substitution command (e.g., `sed 's/Scotland/UK/g' filename`).
- Explore more features and options using `man sed` for detailed information.
