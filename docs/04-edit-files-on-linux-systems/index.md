The `sed` utility in Linux, which stands for "stream editor".<br>

**Sed Basics**<br>
- `sed` can delete lines, substitute text, append text, or extract text from text files.<br>
- By default, `sed` prints the entire file as a stream, but you can modify this behavior using switches.<br>
- Use `-n` to suppress automatic printing of the entire file and selectively print lines.<br>
- Use `sed '1d' filename` to delete the first line in a file.<br>
- With `-i`, you can edit the file directly instead of just printing output.<br>
- To substitute text globally, add `g` at the end of the substitution command (e.g., `sed 's/Scotland/UK/g' filename`).<br>
- Explore more features and options using `man sed` for detailed information.
